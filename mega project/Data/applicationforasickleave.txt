Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell, and after consulting with my doctor, I have been advised to take a few days off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that I will do my best to catch up on any missed work once I return. I will be monitoring my emails and messages during this time and will respond to any urgent queries as soon as I am able.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time. I look forward to returning to work as soon as I am feeling better.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
