Hello Girish, I'm happy to help you with your request for a song! Here's a short and simple song I came up with for you:

(Verse 1)
In the world of words and letters,
Where stories and ideas flow,
There's a writer with a mighty pen,
Who creates and makes things grow.

(Chorus)
Girish, Girish, with your words so bright,
You capture the world in black and white,
Girish, Girish, your stories never end,
They live on in our hearts and minds till the end.

(Verse 2)
From letters and codes, to songs and poems,
You weave a tapestry of dreams,
With every stroke of your pen,
You bring a new world to life, it seems.

(Chorus)
Girish, Girish, with your words so bright,
You capture the world in black and white,
Girish, Girish, your stories never end,
They live on in our hearts and minds till the end.

(Bridge)
In your essays, notes and applications,
You paint a picture so vivid and true,
With your words, you inspire and motivate,
A better world, we're all striving to pursue.

(Chorus)
Girish, Girish, with your words so bright,
You capture the world in black and white,
Girish, Girish, your stories never end,
They live on in our hearts and minds till the end.

(Outro)
So here's to Girish, the writer so grand,
With a heart and soul, so deep and so wide,
May your words continue to inspire and delight,
Now and forever, far and wide.
